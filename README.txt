Description:
In this project I built a retrieval-based chatbot system for a restaurant serving Mexican cuisine. I used a combination of tf-idf scoring, word embedding models, and a set of use-defined functions in order to answer any number of questions from a restaurant diner. I constructed a full retrieval-based chatbot system, conversed with your own chatbot creation, and improved the system by adding additional candidate responses!
